# The Well-Tempered Arduino

This is an Arduino and Python project to create sound art based on selected subject themes from The Well-Tempered Clavier by JS Bach.

The user can enable, disable, and transpose up to 5 of the selected melodies at once. These melodies will loop. The tempo is also configurable via a potentiometer.
